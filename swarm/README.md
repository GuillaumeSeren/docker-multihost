# Autoscaling in Docker Swarm with Consul, Registrator and HAProxy with Prometheus monitoring and ELK log aggregation

This folder contains shell scripts that can be used to test autoscaling with Docker and Docker Swarm. They are described in detail in the [blogpost](http://sirile.github.io/2015/07/28/scaling-with-discovery-on-docker-swarm-with-consul-registrator-and-haproxy-with-prometheus-monitoring-and-elk-log-aggregation.html).

After the scripts were updated they can also be used to launch the example in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. More information can be found from the [second blogpost](http://sirile.github.io/2015/08/05/part-2-scaling-in-amazon-aws-vpc-with-docker-docker-machine-consul-registrator-haproxy-elk-and-prometheus.html).
