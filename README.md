# Docker multihost

This project contains scripts and helper functions to utilize with Docker and multihost use. The swarm directory contains examples used with the corresponding [blogpost](http://sirile.github.io/2015/07/28/scaling-with-discovery-on-docker-swarm-with-consul-registrator-and-haproxy-with-prometheus-monitoring-and-elk-log-aggregation.html). The experimental folder contains code snippets used when trying to get the overlay networking to play nicely with Docker Swarm and Consul based service discovery.

After the scripts in swarm-folder were updated they can also be used to launch the example in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. More information can be found from the [second blogpost](http://sirile.github.io/2015/08/05/part-2-scaling-in-amazon-aws-vpc-with-docker-docker-machine-consul-registrator-haproxy-elk-and-prometheus.html).
