# Docker multihost

This project contains scripts and helper functions to utilize with Docker and multihost use. The swarm directory contains examples used with the corresponding [blogpost](http://sirile.github.io/2015/12/14/automatic-scaling-with-docker-19-and-overlay-network-locally-and-in-aws.html).

The experimental folder contains code snippets used when trying to get the overlay networking to play nicely with Docker Swarm and Consul based service discovery and has now been deprecated. A new experimental folder may follow when I get to play with the new Docker security features.
