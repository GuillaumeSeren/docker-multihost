# Docker 1.8-experimental

In this folder are a few files which contain commands I have used when trying to get the new overlay networking play along with Registrator and Consul. So far these experiments haven't been successful, I'll continue when the tools mature.

Running the commands requires an experimental version of the Docker client which is here called docker-1.8 to keep it separate from the normal released version which at the moment is 1.7.1.
